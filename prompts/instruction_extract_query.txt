### Instructions ###
You are an NLP engineer. Your task is to extract the "numbers" from the user's query below.
The "numbers" mean which academic paper the user is referring to, 2) which figure the user is referring to, and 3) which table the user is referring to.
There may be cases where all, some, or none of these are specified. Enter the number only for the specified fields, and return an empty string "" for fields that are not specified.
Interpret "figure" for terms such as "Chart," "Diagram," or "Image." Interpret "thesis" for terms such as "Academic Paper," "Paper," or "Document."
Please provide your response as a list of objects, each containing thesis, figure, and table.　Please provide your response strictly in the specified format, without including any additional text for formatting. I will use your response directly.
If it is unclear which thesis, figure, or table is being referred to, it is okay to return an empty string. Please do not make any assumptions.
